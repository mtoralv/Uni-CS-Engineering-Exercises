# 🎓 Academic Software Engineering Portfolio

This repository is a live documentation of my academic journey and technical evolution at the University of Málaga. It tracks my progress from foundational procedural programming to modern, object-oriented system design.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies
* **Languages:** Java (Object-Oriented Programming) and C++ (Procedural Logic).
* **Version Control:** Git (Branch management, conflict resolution, and cross-platform synchronization).
* **Methodologies:** Clean Code standards, package architecture, and structural refactoring.

## 📂 Curriculum Structure

### **Year 1: The Foundation**

#### **Semester 01: C++ Foundations**
* **Directory:** `year_01/Semester_01_C++/`
* **Focus:** Introduction to algorithmic logic, flow control, etc.
* **⚠️ Status:** **Legacy / Exploratory.** This directory is preserved in its original state as a benchmark of my early learning process before having an organized structure. While "messy" and incomplete, it demonstrates the starting point of my procedural logic development.

#### **Semester 02: Java & OOP Systems**
* **Directory:** `year_01/semester_02_java/`
* **Focus:** Transitioning to the Object-Oriented paradigm and the Java ecosystem.
* **Key Topics:** Class architecture, inheritance, polymorphism, and strict package management.
* **Refinement:** This section represents a significant shift toward professional-grade organization and standardized coding practices.

## 🚀 Problem Solving Milestones (done while setting up this repo)

### **1. Professional Refactoring & Structural Integrity**
I recently executed a full-scale refactor of this repository's directory hierarchy. This involved migrating from non-standard naming formats to professional, code-friendly conventions (e.g., removing brackets/spaces) to ensure seamless Java package compatibility.

### **2. Conflict Resolution & Sync Management**
Working across multiple machines (PC and Laptop), I developed a robust Git workflow to maintain history parity. I have successfully managed complex "detached HEAD" states and merge conflicts, ensuring no data loss during major structural changes.

### **3. JVM Package Optimization**
Successfully diagnosed and resolved IDE/Compiler conflicts caused by illegal directory characters. This deep-dive into the Java Virtual Machine's directory-to-package mapping ensures all current work is fully portable and standard-compliant.

## ⚙️ How to Run
Most exercises are designed for terminal-based execution. 

**Important:** For Java files, always compile from the project root to respect package declarations:
```bash
# Example for a Java exercise
javac year_01/semester_02_java/testing/helloworld/HelloWorld.java
java year_01.semester_02_java.testing.helloworld.HelloWorld
